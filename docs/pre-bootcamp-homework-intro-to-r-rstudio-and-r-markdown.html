<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Objectives</h3>
<p>Welcome to statistic and data science portion of the Math-to-Industry Bootcamp! In this bootcamp, you will build your statistical, data, and computing literacy. <em>Doing</em> statistics and data science requires statistical software. Preparing for this aspect of the bootcamp is the focus of your pre-bootcamp homework. Specifically, the objectives of this assignment are to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download and install R and RStudio on your machine.</li>
<li>Become familiar with the RStudio environment and learn how to perform basic calculations in the console.</li>
<li>Begin working with data in RStudio, including importing data, examining the structure of data, visualizing single variables, and numerically computing summary statistics.</li>
<li>Become familiar with using R Markdown to organize, communicate, and save your work in a reproducible format.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should allocate 2-3 hours for this assignment prior to the bootcamp. If you are stuck or have questions, feel free to email David Shuman (<a href="mailto:dshuman1@macalester.edu">dshuman1@macalester.edu</a>). David will also be available to answer any questions at the IMA from 2:30-3:30 on Wednesday, June 26th, the day before this section of the bootcamp begins.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Introduction to RStudio</h3>
<p>As you might guess from the name, “Data Science” requires <em>data</em>. Working with modern (large, messy) data sets requires statistical software. We’ll exclusively use <strong>RStudio</strong>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s free</li>
<li>it’s open source</li>
<li>it has a huge online community<br />
</li>
<li>it’s the industry standard</li>
<li>it can be used to create <em>reproducible</em> and lovely documents (In fact, this tutorial that you’re currently reading was constructed entirely within RStudio!)</li>
</ul>
<div id="download-r-rstudio" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.1</span> Download R &amp; RStudio</h4>
<p>To get started, take the following two steps in the given order. Further, if you already have R/RStudio, make sure to update to the most recent versions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Download &amp; install R</strong>: <a href="https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/" class="uri">https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/</a><br />
</li>
<li><p><strong>Download &amp; install RStudio</strong>: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p>
<p>Be sure to download the <em>free</em> version!!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s the difference between R and RStudio? Mainly, RStudio requires R – thus it does everything R does <em>and more</em>. We will be using RStudio exclusively.</p>
</div>
<div id="rstudio-basics" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2.2</span> RStudio Basics</h4>
<p>Once you open RStudio, you’ll see four panes, each serving a different function:</p>
<p><img src="images/RStudioImage.001.jpg" height="475px" /></p>
<p>The short video below provides a quick tour of RStudio and summarizes some basic features of the console (the main points of which are summarized below).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JfIo2Ua_oqQ/" title="Video 1"><img src="images/vid1.png" /></a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Video summary:</strong></p>
<p>In the RStudio console we can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform simple calculations</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span>
## [1] 5</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>utilize built-in RStudio <strong>functions</strong> to which we supply the necessary <strong>arguments</strong>: <code>function(arguments)</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">sqrt</span>(<span class="dv">9</span>)
## [1] 3
<span class="kw">sum</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>)

## [1] 2 2 2
<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>)
## [1] 3 3</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>install new (open source) RStudio packages that contain specialized functions written by other RStudio users. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;tidyverse&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">dependencies =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre></div></li>

<p><strong>Debugging &amp; Anti-Frustration Tips</strong></p>
<p>Making mistakes is inevitable and necessary when learning a new language. The following will save you some time and frustration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spelling and capitalization matter. <code>this</code> and <code>ThiS</code> are different.</li>
<li>With the cursor at the <code>&gt;</code> in the console, use the up arrow to access previous lines without re-typing. You can also find previous lines in the <code>History</code> tab in the upper-right panel of RStudio.</li>
<li>Type <code>?rep</code> to get help and examples for the <code>rep</code> function (for example).</li>
<li>Find help online! There’s a massive RStudio community at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" class="uri">http://stackoverflow.com/</a> If you have a question, somebody’s probably already written about it. Or just google.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div class="exercise">
<p><span id="exr:unnamed-chunk-148" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 5.1  (Warm Up)  </strong></span>Use RStudio as a simple calculator to do the following:<br />
a. Perform a simple calculation: calculate <code>90/3</code>.<br />
b. RStudio has built-in <em>functions</em> to which we supply the necessary <em>arguments</em>: <code>function(arguments)</code>. Use the built-in function <code>sqrt</code> to calculate the square root of 25.<br />
c. Use the built-in function <code>rep</code> to repeat the number “5” eight times.<br />
d. Use the <code>seq</code> function to create the vector <code>(0, 3, 6, 9, 12)</code>. (The video doesnt cover this!)<br />
e. Create a new vector by concatenating three repetitions of the vector from the previous part.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.1</span> Getting Started</h4>
<p>RStudio provides a powerful tool for working with data. The following video illustrates some of the basics. It features data related to the fivethirtyeight.com article <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-hip-hop-lyrics/">Hip-Hop is Turning on Donald Trump</a> that we can access through the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> RStudio package. A summary of the video is provided below.</p>

<p><strong>Video summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import and name data</strong><br />
How we import data into RStudio depends on its format (eg: Excel spreadsheet, csv file, txt file) and storage locations (eg: online, within Wiki, desktop). In this example, we work with the <code>hiphop_cand_lyrics</code> data that are stored in the <code>fivethirtyeight</code> RStudio package. We store this under a shorter name (<code>HipHop</code>) using the assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code>. NOTE: RStudio ignores any content after the <code>#</code>. Thus we use this to ‘comment’ and organize our code.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># load the fivethirtyeight package</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(fivethirtyeight)

<span class="co"># store hiphop_cand_lyrics under a shorter name</span>
HipHop &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>hiphop_cand_lyrics   </code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tidy data</strong></p>
<p><em>Tidy</em> data tables have three key features:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each row represents a <strong>unit of observation</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Each column represents a <strong>variable</strong> (ie. an attribute of the cases that can vary from case to case). Each variable is one of two types:
<ul>
<li><strong>quantitative</strong> = numerical<br />
</li>
<li><strong>categorical</strong> = discrete possibilities/categories<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each entry contains a single data value; no analysis, summaries, footnotes, comments, etc., and only one value per cell</li>
</ol>
<p>In the video example, cases are individual mentions of a presidential candidate in a song, and variables include the song name, artist, candidate, sentiment, etc.<br />

<li><p><strong>Examining a single variable</strong><br />
To access and focus on a single variable, we can use the <code>$</code> notation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">HipHop<span class="op">$</span>candidate
HipHop<span class="op">$</span>album_release_date</code></pre></div>
<p>It’s important to understand the format/class of each variable (quantitative, categorical, date, etc) in both its meaning and its structure within RStudio:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">class</span>(HipHop<span class="op">$</span>candidate)

<span class="kw">class</span>(HipHop<span class="op">$</span>album_release_date)
## [1] &quot;integer&quot;</code></pre></div>
<p>If a variable is categorical (either in <code>character</code> or <code>factor</code> format), we can determine its <code>levels</code> / category labels:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">levels</span>(HipHop<span class="op">$</span>candidate)
## NULL
<span class="kw">levels</span>(<span class="kw">factor</span>(HipHop<span class="op">$</span>candidate))

<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.2</span> Univariate Graphical Summaries</h4>
<p>Once we understand its structure, we can <em>examine</em> and <em>tell a story</em> with our data! Data visualization is the first natural step. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Visualizations help us understand what we’re working with: What are the scales of our variables? Are there any outliers, i.e. unusual cases? What are the patterns among our variables?<br />
</li>
<li>This understanding will inform our next steps: What statistical tool / model is appropriate?<br />
</li>
<li>Once our analysis is complete, visualizations are a powerful way to communicate our findings and tell a story.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll start with <strong>univariate</strong> visualizations using the <code>ggplot()</code> function. Though the learning curve is steep, its “grammar” is intuitive and generalizable once mastered. <code>ggplot()</code> is stored in the <code>ggplot2</code> package. You only have to type this once every time you open RStudio (and once in your markdown document):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(ggplot2)</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The best way to learn about <code>ggplot()</code> is to just play around - don’t worry about memorizing the syntax. Rather, focus on the <em>patterns</em> and <em>potential</em> of their application.</p>
<div id="categorical-variables" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.2.1</span> Categorical Variables</h5>
<p>The appropriate visualization depends on whether the variable is <em>categorical</em> or <em>quantitative</em>. Consider the <em>categorical</em> <code>candidate</code> variable which contains the candidate mentioned in each song in the sample. A table provides a simple summary of the number of mentions of each candidate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">table</span>(HipHop<span class="op">$</span>candidate)
## 
##      Ben Carson  Bernie Sanders  Chris Christie    Donald Trump 
##               1               2               2             268 
## Hillary Clinton        Jeb Bush   Mike Huckabee        Ted Cruz 
##              92               9               2               1</code></pre></div>
<p>A <strong>bar chart</strong> provides a visualization of this table. In examining the bar chart, keep your eyes on <strong>variability</strong> (how are cases spread among the categories?) and <strong>take-home message</strong>. Try the code below that builds up from a simple to a customized bar chart. At each step determine how each piece of code contributes to the plot. Upon examining these plots, notice that Donald Trump is mentioned much more frequently than the other candidates. Hillary Clinton has far fewer mentions than Trump but far more than any other candidate.</p>

<div id="quantitative-variables" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.2.2</span> Quantitative Variables</h5>

<p>The <em>quantitative</em> <code>album_release_date</code> variable contains the release date of each song that mentions Clinton. Quantitative variables require different summary tools than categorical variables. For example, a table of the quantitative <code>album_release_date</code> numbers isn’t very illuminating:</p>

<p>Here we’ll focus on 2 of many methods for visualizing the distribution of a quantitative variable: <strong>histograms and density plots</strong>. In examining these viz, keep your eyes on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>center</strong> (what’s a typical value?)</li>
<li><strong>variability</strong> (how spread out are the values?)</li>
<li><strong>shape</strong> (how are values distributed?)</li>
<li><strong>outliers</strong></li>
<li><strong>take-home message</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<div id="histograms" class="section level6">
<h6><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.2.2.1</span> Histograms</h6>
<p>Histograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Try out the code below that builds up from a simple to a customized histogram. At each step determine how each piece of code contributes to the plot. Upon examination, note the take-home message of the histograms: Clinton has been part of the hip hop landscape since the early 1990s, though her “popularity” peaked around 2008 and has decreased since.</p>

<div id="density-plots" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.3</span> Density Plots</h4>
<p>Density plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting cases into discrete bins, the “density” of cases is calculated across the entire range of values. The greater the number of cases, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve <strong>always equals 1</strong> and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range. If you’ve taken Probability, you can think of the sample density curve as an estimate of the population probability density function. Try the following code.</p>

<p>After completing the above exercises, you should recognize some <code>ggplot()</code> patterns!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ggplot() patterns</strong> <code>ggplot()</code>, short for “grammar of graphics” plot, is a powerful function. We’ll focus on the <em>patterns</em> of this function over the memorization of its syntax. For example, all of our <code>ggplot()</code> code had the following patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1 of the code specified the name of our data and the variable of interest within that data: <code>ggplot(MY DATA, aes(x = VARIABLE ON X AXIS))</code> where <code>aes</code> is short for <code>aesthetics</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>Except for the last line of the plot code, lines end with <code>+</code>. This tells RStudio that we’re not done with the plot code yet.<br />
</li>
<li>The second row of the code indicates what kind of plot we want to make. Thus far, we’ve seen <code>geom_bar()</code>, <code>geom_histogram()</code>, <code>geom_density()</code>.<br />
</li>
<li>We can change the x-axis and y-axis labels using <code>labs(x = &quot;MY X LABEL&quot;, y = &quot;MY Y LABEL&quot;)</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div id="numerical-summaries" class="section level6">
<h6><span class="header-section-number">5.1.3.3.0.1</span> Numerical Summaries</h6>
<p>We can also use RStudio to compute summary statistics, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation of a variable. Here is an example for the density plot above:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">mean</span>(justHC<span class="op">$</span>album_release_date)
## [1] 2008
<span class="kw">median</span>(justHC<span class="op">$</span>album_release_date)
## [1] 2008
<span class="kw">sd</span>(justHC<span class="op">$</span>album_release_date)
## [1] 6.049</code></pre></div>
<p>Recall that the mean and median are two measures of the <em>trend</em> or <em>typical</em> value of a variable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>mean</strong><br />
The arithmetic average. Example: the mean of <span class="math inline">\((x_1,...,x_5) = (1, 6, 3, 20, 6)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[\overline{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^5 x_i}{5} = 7.2\]</span></li>
<li><strong>median</strong><br />
The 50th percentile. Example: the median of <span class="math inline">\((x_1,...,x_5) = (1, 6, 3, 20, 6)\)</span> is 6 since this is the middle number when we sort the sample: <span class="math inline">\((1, 3, 6, 6, 20)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the simple range of scores, <strong>variance</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> are common measures of <em>variability</em>. Suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> sample values <span class="math inline">\((x_1,...,x_n)\)</span> with a sample mean of <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sample <strong>variance</strong> is loosely interpreted as the typical <em>squared</em> deviations of individual cases from the mean: <span class="math display">\[var(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}(x_i - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}\]</span><br />
Note that the variance has (original units)<sup>2</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Sample <strong>standard deviation</strong> is loosely interpreted as the typical deviation of individual cases from the mean: <span class="math display">\[sd(x) = \sqrt{var(x)}\]</span> Note that the standard deviation has units on the original scale, and is therefore easier to interpret than the variance!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> R Markdown and Reproducible Research</h3>
<p>By this point, you’ve tried out some syntax in the RStudio console. There are pros and cons to the console:</p>
<ul>
<li>The console is <strong>good</strong> for testing out RStudio code and other temporary work.</li>
<li>The console is <strong>bad</strong> for organizing, communicating, and saving your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the video below, you’ll learn about R Markdown which is <strong>great</strong> for organizing, communicating, and saving your work! In fact, this entire tutorial that you’re reading now was constructed using R Markdown! The basic idea is that you can use R Markdown to create an html / pdf file that includes your text, LaTeX equations, R code (what you type into RStudio), and R output (the corresponding results). In doing so…</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s no need to copy and paste between RStudio and Word</li>
<li>you have documentation of how you arrived at your conclusions</li>
<li>revisions are easy; you can change your code and update your entire document at the click of a button!</li>
<li>your work is reproducible by others!</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reproducible research</strong> is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them. - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research">Reproducible Research, Coursera</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use R Markdown, you will write an R Markdown formatted file in RStudio and then ask RStudio to <strong>knit</strong> it into an HTML document (or occasionally a PDF or MS Word document).</p>
<p>The following video on R Markdown was compiled for a different course, but the majority of its content translates here!</p>
